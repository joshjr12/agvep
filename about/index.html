        My experience  
      </h1>
      <p style="color:#444">
        As a student, I entered the redcross program unexperience and not knowing alot. But Redcross changed that for me overtime. I took a 2 to 4 months course to learn about cpr , how to properly save someone underwater and so much information i didnt know redcross help me with that. I'm now a certified lifeguard with both of my certifications. I can honestly say that redcross is a amazing program.
