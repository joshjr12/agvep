        As a student, I entered the redcross program unexperience and not knowing alot. But Redcross changed that for me overtime. I took a 2 to 4 months course to learn about CPR , how to properly save someone when drowning underwater and so much information i didnt know about redcross help me with that. I'm now a certified lifeguard with both of my certifications. I can honestly say that redcross is a amazing program.
